#What is Gulp?

Open source JS toolkit and task runner

Front end build system, built on Node.js and installed via NPM

Save valuable time by automating the completion of repetitive tasks! (minification! testing! linting! setting up local dev servers! bus your cache!)

# How does it work?

- Built using node streams - a continuous flow of data that can be manipulated asynchronously
- File operations are handled via pipe operators - output of one plugin becomes input for another
- Only when all plugins are processed is the file altered

# Steps

tasks described in gulpfile.js
